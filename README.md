### Professional Profile
Technology executive with a resilient leadership track record in directing complex projects and fostering team growth. As a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence, I bridge the gap between advanced analytical research and sustainable business value by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing (GCP/Azure) into robust enterprise systems[cite: 5, 8].

My expertise spans over three decades of navigating shifting economic and regulatory landscapes. I possess comprehensive knowledge across IT domains, including Strategic Planning, PMO establishment (PMI/Agile), and Corporate Governance. My technical foundation in Electronic Engineering and Software Development (.NET, C#, and C) has enabled me to drive innovation in the financial sector—designing systems for pension funds (Afores) and risk analysis—as well as in the energy and industrial sectors through large-scale process automation and control systems.
